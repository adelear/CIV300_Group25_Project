            <h1 class="mid-title">Our Objectives</h1>
            <p class="mid-text"> Many areas in the Philippines with tropical river catchments frequently experience flash floods, 
                intense rainfalls, and typhoons <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. Just recently, Typhoon Fung-Wong devastated the Philippines as 
                the second typhoon in one week, causing flooding that killed at least six individuals, as well as over 1.4 million 
                people to evacuate, showing how vulnerable the country’s infrastructure is to natural disasters <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.  
                Amid the disaster, a popular video circulated online that showed a dog stranded on a metal rooftop, scared and alone, 
                and getting swept away with rising water as people watched in fear. This video moved our team, seeing as the burden 
                of the floods is shared beyond just human communities, and the inefficient infrastructure impacts many more lives 
                than statistics can record. Our mission is to raise awareness of the flooding in the Philippines by observing how 
                inefficient infrastructure and the lack of professional responsibility heavily impact environmental and 
                social sustainability.

            <h1 class="mid-title">The Consequences of Inaction</h1>
            <p class="mid-text"> 
                The lack of professional responsibility in the Philippines is a significant cause of the ineffective flood control infrastructure. According to an audit done by the Commission on Audit <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>,
                 an independent constitutional commission, 421 out of 8000 recorded flood control projects, like river bank protection, drainage tunnels, dams and reservoirs, were found to be non-existent. Essentially, the projects were listed on paper, but no construction took place, as the funds meant for the projects were diverted to corrupt engineers, and contractors for personal gain <a href="#ref4">[4]</a>. Another audit done by the same commission found similar outcomes – 3047 locally funded projects worth a total of P131.57 billion (3M CAD) failed due to inadequate planning, detailed engineering, supervision and monitoring <a href="#ref5">[5]</a>. The lack of effective flood control infrastructure caused by poor professional responsibility exacerbates the massive flooding caused by typhoons. These floods negatively impact the environment and displace communities, underscoring how professional responsibility directly affects environmental and social sustainability.
            </p>
            <p class="mid-text">
                The flooding events in the Philippines have various negative impacts on its environmental sustainability. Studies have shown that previous flood events in the region such as Super Typhoon Odette in 2021, 
                caused significant damage to forest cover, which impacts poor communities that rely on them for resources <a href="#ref6">[6]</a>. 
                Flooding duration, depth and velocity all contribute to damage and reduced mortality of trees <a href="#ref7">[7]</a>. 
                This impacts wildlife, such as 29 threatened species in the Philippines, which are highly dependent on forests <a href="#ref8">[8]</a>, 
                raising concerns about habitat degradation. Animals in urban areas are also vulnerable during flood events in Southeast Asia, causing 
                organizations to advocate for more animal rescue measures <a href="#ref9">[9]</a>. Moreover, previous flood events have spread water from 
                lead-polluted rivers, contaminating soil in the Bulacan region of the Philippines, leading to the detection of high lead exposure 
                among local children <a href="#ref10">[10]</a>. Furthermore, it has been shown that rainstorms and typhoon events contribute to soil erosion, 
                with over 57 million cubic meters of eroded sediment lost during Typhoon Koppu in 2015 <a href="#ref11">[11]</a>. This is consequential because eroded soil 
                loses its ability to store nutrients and water needed for plant growth <a href="#ref11">[11]</a>. The impacts of flooding on the environment are multifaceted, 
                prompting the need to address flaws in flood control measures.
            </p>

            <p class="mid-text">
                The significant flooding in the Philippines heavily impacted many communities, leaving a detrimental toll on the country’s 
                social sustainability. Given the severe aftermath of floods, communities are left displaced. This is evident when 
                600,000 citizens in Davao City, in July 2024, experienced harsh flooding, leading to a significant amount of 
                agricultural damage and residents being forced from their homes <a href="#ref12">[12]</a>. Additionally, floods often 
                result in communities living in poor and unsafe conditions. In some cases, residents are offered free housing, often 
                requiring relocation. However, due to limited options, many resorted to makeshift homes made of scrap 
                because they were too far from their sources of income and community <a href="#ref13">[13]</a>. Moreover, inequality in the 
                community becomes more evident when those in power handling flood-control funding neglect the needs of 
                the unfortunate. When a contractor couple in charge of P31.5 billion in flood-control projects is 
                discovered owning 40 luxury vehicles <a href="#ref14">[14]</a>, residents are outraged as their work was often non-functional, 
                nonexistent, or caused flooding <a href="#ref15">[15]</a>, shattering people’s trust and ability to rely on professionals to 
                protect them. These events ultimately left communities vulnerable, undermining the social sustainability in the Philippines.
