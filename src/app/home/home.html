            <p class="mid-text"> Many areas in the Philippines with tropical river catchments frequently 
                experience flash floods, intense rainfalls, and typhoons [Journal Article]. Just recently, 
                Typhoon Fung-Wong devastated the Philippines as the second typhoon in one week, 
                causing flooding that killed at least six individuals, as well as over 1.4 million 
                people to evacuate, showing how vulnerable the country’s infrastructure is to 
                natural disasters [Recent Flooding]. Our mission is to raise awareness of the flooding in 
                Philippines by observing how inefficient infrastructure and the lack of professional 
                responsibility heavily impact environmental and social sustainability.
