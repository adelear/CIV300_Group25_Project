            <h2>The Density and Salinity of Water and How it Impacts Flooding</h2>
            <p>
                The coastal regions of the Philippines consist of bodies of water that mix fresh water with 
                sea water (Paper). When typhoons occur and bring large amounts of rainwater, the significant 
                amount of freshwater reduces the salinity and density in the bodies of water. This mix of 
                rainwater and salty seawater disrupt the normal flow patterns (Article), resulting in slow 
                draining, and worsens the flooding conditions in places such as the Manila Bay. This is due
                 to the fact that with the more dense layer of saltwater flowing downwards through less dense
                  fresh water layers, this flooded water resists infiltration, thus, slowly enters soil.

            <h2>Study of Hurricanes and Typhoons in Philippines</h2>
            <p>
               The Philippines is positioned in one of the most typhoon-prone regions in the world, which results
                in the country frequently experiencing typhoons, which cause destructive winds and flooding that 
                affect millions of people. Therefore, by understanding the development of typhoons and their destructive
                effects, we can more effectively implement solutions to mitigating their destruction. The following 
                sections will describe what typhoons and hurricanes are, how they develop, and their effects.
            </p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                The most severe form of tropical cyclones, circular wind patterns, are known as hurricanes. They are 
                a large, rotating storm where the winds move around a calm center. They have wind speeds of over 118 km
                per hour, which can cause extreme amounts of property damage. When they form over the north Pacific as 
                in the Philippines, they are referred to as typhoons.

            </p>
            
            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>
                The warm ocean water near the equator heats up and adds moisture to the air above it. Because the air 
                molecules now have more kinetic energy, they expand, lowering the pressure. The surrounding air with 
                higher pressure then rushes into the low pressure center, but because of the Coriolis effect, it deflects
                to the right, causing the storm to spin counterclockwise. The friction near the surface also reduces the
                effect of Coriolis and allows the air to tend to the low-pressure center instead of circling around it. 
                The new air rises, causing the moisture to condense, which releases large amounts of latent heat into 
                the storm. This causes the pressure to drop further, increasing the pressure gradient force, which causes
                more air to rush into the center, creating a positive feedback loop that intensifies the hurricane.
            </p>
                
            <h3>Effects</h3>
            <p> 
                Because of the extreme pressure differential between the eye and the eyewall, air accelerates to the center 
                and causes destructive winds of over 118 km per hour, which can destroy infrastructure like buildings and 
                power lines. The strong winds also push ocean water toward the coast, which causes flooding. This is also 
                exacerbated by the low-pressure center creating a rising dome of water, which effectively raises the sea level.

            <h2>Three Air Cells</h2>
            <p>
                The physical location of the Philippines on Earth plays a role in its being flood-prone. To understand this, 
                we first have to explain the three convection cells of Earth that impact the climate of a region based on 
                the latitude. Both the Northern and Southern hemispheres can be divided into three major convection cells, 
                as shown in Figure 1. These are driven by uneven solar distribution received by the Earth and play a major 
                role in creating climate zones, as will be explained. As seen from Figure 1, there are three convection 
                cells: the Hadley, Ferrel and Polar cells. These will be further explained below.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Hadley cell spans from the Equator (0° latitude) to the 30° latitude mark. The Equator receives the highest
                amount of solar energy on Earth, causing air to be heated and to rise, creating a low pressure zone. This air is
                moist, so when it increases in elevation, it will cool and condense, creating heavy rainfall. Areas near the Equator 
                are thus covered by an area called the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone, where storms frequently occur. The now cooled 
                and dry air will move forward to the 30° latitude, where it sinks creating a high pressure zone. As a side note, these 
                create dry conditions at this latitude (like the Sahara desert) and the pressure gradient causes the air pockets to travel 
                back towards the equator, completing the convection cell. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The Philippines having a latitude of 12° North belong inside the Hadley cell, explaining it’s heavy rainfal (shown in Figure 2). 
                Briefly describing the other two cells, the Ferrel Cell has sinking air at the 30° latitude and then rising air at the 60° latitude, 
                due to meeting the colder air from the Polar cell, which is referred to as the Polar Front. Since the Poles receive the least solar 
                energy, the air is extremely low and sinks, creating a high pressure zone forcing air to the lower pressure zone at the 60° latitude, 
                where the air rises to complete the cell.
            </p>

            <p>
                The torrential rainfall produced as the result of the Philippines being in the ITCZ creates flash floods, as it receives 2768 mm of 
                rain per year [1] In comparison, Canada receives 530 mm of rain per year [1]. This contributes to the phenomenon of typhoons, mentioned 
                in a previous blog (insert link), creating devastating effects. Although these natural phenomenon are inevitable due to the geographical 
                location of the Philippines, there have been several issues with the infrastructure for minimizing the loss of life and property 
                (as described in the homepage (insert link). With a population of over 114 million [2] and having a GDP per capita of $4,320 USD 
                (as opposed to Canada’s $54,930 USD) [3], relocation is not a viable option for the people of the Philippines. As a result, the FloodSafe 
                Philippines organization fights to improve infrastructure to address floods and to push public policy reforms in the Philippines.
