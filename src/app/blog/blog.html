            <h2>The Density and Salinity of Water and How it Impacts Flooding</h2>
            <p>
                The coastal regions of the Philippines consist of bodies of water that mix fresh water with sea water <a href="https://ijsred.com/volume8/issue3/IJSRED-V8I3P562.pdf">[1]</a>. 
                When typhoons occur and bring large amounts of rainwater, the significant amount of freshwater reduces the 
                salinity and density in the bodies of water. Understanding the changes in the water is essential, as the 
                salinity and density of water influences water flow and worsens flooding conditions.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                Bodies of water, especially  those located in coast regions are naturally formed with layers of different water salinity. 
                Saltwater is more dense than freshwater, and thus, tends to lie below freshwater layers. However, with typhoons bringing 
                about intense rainfall, increasing freshwater levels, the mix of rainwater and salty seawater disrupt normal flow patterns <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/less-salty-ocean-right-typhoons-alley">[2]</a>. 
            </p>

            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p> 
                As intense rainfall causes rainwater to flow into bays, the layers of water on the surface become significantly less dense 
                because of the saltwater mixed in them. This salty seawater flows downwards through less dense freshwater layers, preventing 
                bodies of water from efficiently mixing together. The denser saltwater remains on the bottom layer with the less dense freshwater 
                above it, slowing the flow of water and preventing infiltration into soil.
            </p>

            <h3>Effects</h3>
            <p>
                The stratification caused by the mix of salinity slows the drainage of the flood, leading to faster flooding in coastal and urban 
                areas of Philippines. The inefficiently mixed water drains into soil significantly slower, causing the floodwater to continue to 
                accumulate with the intense rain. This change in the flow dynamic heavily impacts low-income communities in the coastal regions, 
                where the infrastructure and drainage system are neglected by professionals, posing significant challenges in both social and 
                environmental sustainability.

            <h2>Study of Hurricanes and Typhoons in Philippines</h2>
            
            <p>
The Philippines is positioned in one of the most tropical cyclone-prone regions in the world, the Northwestern Pacific Basin, causing the country to frequently experience devastating storms that bring destructive winds, rainfall, and flooding that affect millions of people. By understanding the development of tropical cyclones and why they are so destructive, we can more effectively implement solutions to minimize their risk. The following sections describe what tropical cyclones are, how they develop, and their destructive effects.
            </p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
Tropical cyclones are large, rotating weather systems that typically develop over warm ocean water. A cross-sectional diagram of a tropical cyclone is shown in Figure 3. They have a calm, low-pressure center, referred to as an eye, which is surrounded by a ring of tall thunderstorms, known as the eyewall, which produce strong winds and heavy rain. The most severe form of tropical cyclones, with wind speeds of over 118 km per hour, are classified as hurricanes. When they form over the northwestern Pacific Ocean, as in the case of the Philippines, they are referred to as typhoons.

            </p>
            
            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>
Typhoons begin over warm oceans near the equator, where heat and moisture are transferred to the air above. The air molecules now have more kinetic energy, so they expand, lowering the pressure. The high pressure surrounding air then rushes into the low-pressure center from the pressure gradient force (PGF), but because of the Coriolis force, it deflects to the right (in the nothern hemisphere), causing the storm to spin counterclockwise. The friction near the surface also reduces the effect of Coriolis, allowing the PGF to overcome the Coriolis force. This enables the air to move toward the low-pressure center instead of circling around it. This forces the new air to rise, causing the water vapour to condense, which releases large amounts of latent heat into the system. This causes the pressure to drop further, increasing the PGF, so more air rushes into the center, creating a positive feedback loop that intensifies the tropical cyclone into a typhoon.

            </p>

            <p>
A reason for the Philippines being so typhoon-prone is its position within the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), an area near the equator where the northeast and southeast trade winds meet, forcing air upward and creating thunderstorms, which release massive amounts of latent heat into the atmosphere as the water vapour in the air condenses. This effect frequently produces low-pressure areas, which can trigger the formation of typhoons.
            </p>
                
            <h3>Effects</h3>
            <p> 
Because of the extreme pressure differential between the eye and the eyewall, air accelerates to the center and results in destructive winds, which can destroy buildings, and topple trees and power lines. The intense winds also push ocean water toward the coast, known as a storm surge, which leads to coastal flooding. Additionally, the low-pressure eye of the typhoon can create a rising dome of water, which effectively raises the sea level and can further increase flooding. The heavy rainfall associated with the eyewall can also contribute to inland flooding, highlighting the dangers of typhoons.

            <h2>Three Air Cells</h2>
            <p>
                The physical location of the Philippines on Earth plays a role in its being flood-prone. To understand this, 
                we first have to explain the three convection cells of Earth that impact the climate of a region based on 
                the latitude. Both the Northern and Southern hemispheres can be divided into three major convection cells, 
                as shown in Figure 1. These are driven by uneven solar distribution received by the Earth and play a major 
                role in creating climate zones, as will be explained. As seen from Figure 1, there are three convection 
                cells: the Hadley, Ferrel and Polar cells. These will be further explained below.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Hadley cell spans from the Equator (0° latitude) to the 30° latitude mark. The Equator receives the highest
                amount of solar energy on Earth, causing air to be heated and to rise, creating a low pressure zone. This air is
                moist, so when it increases in elevation, it will cool and condense, creating heavy rainfall. Areas near the Equator 
                are thus covered by an area called the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone, where storms frequently occur. The now cooled 
                and dry air will move forward to the 30° latitude, where it sinks creating a high pressure zone. As a side note, these 
                create dry conditions at this latitude (like the Sahara desert) and the pressure gradient causes the air pockets to travel 
                back towards the equator, completing the convection cell. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The Philippines having a latitude of 12° North belong inside the Hadley cell, explaining it’s heavy rainfal (shown in Figure 2). 
                Briefly describing the other two cells, the Ferrel Cell has sinking air at the 30° latitude and then rising air at the 60° latitude, 
                due to meeting the colder air from the Polar cell, which is referred to as the Polar Front. Since the Poles receive the least solar 
                energy, the air is extremely low and sinks, creating a high pressure zone forcing air to the lower pressure zone at the 60° latitude, 
                where the air rises to complete the cell.
            </p>

            <p>
                The torrential rainfall produced as the result of the Philippines being in the ITCZ creates flash floods, as it receives 2768 mm of 
                rain per year <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/precipitation">[5]</a> In comparison, Canada receives 530 mm of rain per year <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/precipitation">[5]</a>. This contributes to the phenomenon of typhoons, mentioned 
                in a previous blog, creating devastating effects. Although these natural phenomenon are inevitable due to the geographical 
                location of the Philippines, there have been several issues with the infrastructure for minimizing the loss of life and property 
                (as described in the homepage). With a population of over 114 million <a href="https://data.who.int/countries/608">[6]</a> and having a GDP per capita of $4,320 USD 
                (as opposed to Canada’s $54,930 USD) <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPDPC@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD">[7]</a>, relocation is not a viable option for the people of the Philippines. As a result, the FloodSafe 
                Philippines organization fights to improve infrastructure to address floods and to push public policy reforms in the Philippines.

            <h2>Thunderstorms</h2>
            <p>
In the Philippines, thunderstorms are frequent due to the country’s warm and moist climate and location in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, where trade winds meet and air is forced upwards. This weather phenomenon can bring heavy rainfall and strong winds that can cause flooding and damage infrastructure. Thunderstorms are characterized by heavy rainfall, strong winds, and anvil-shaped clouds.
            </p>

            <p>
Thunderstorms first start developing in an extremely unstable atmosphere when warm, moist air is forced upward, such as from a weather front, colliding air, or a heated surface. As the air expands and cools from rising, when it hits the dew point, the water vapour condenses, which releases further heat energy, so the air continues to rise until the temperatures balance. This results in a cloud over 20 kilometers tall, called a cumulonimbus. Diagrams of the development stages of a thunderstorm are shown in Figure 4.
            </p>

            <p>
Condensation cannot occur without something for the water to condense on. The particles (carbon soot, dust) in clouds that allow water to condense are referred to as condensation nuclei. Large droplets form in warm clouds when smaller droplets hit each other and increase in size as they fall through the cloud, which is called the collision-coalescence process. However, in very tall clouds, the top part may have freezing temperatures, resulting in ice pellets forming instead around condensation nuclei, which smash into each other as they fall to form even bigger ice pellets.
            </p>

            <p>
Thunderstorms produce several weather effects. When the water droplets as previously mentioned become heavy enough, they fall as rain, potentially producing up to 12 inches of water per hour. The falling rain also drags air down, which creates strong downdrafts that can potentially destroy trees and infrastructure. Additionally, as ice pellets and water droplets collide in a large cloud, they transfer electrical charge, resulting in a large volume of positive charge at the top, a large negative charge in the center, and a small positive charge at the bottom. When the difference in charge between the ground and the cloud become too great, electricity as lighting travels through the air. This heats the air so quickly that it expands at a rate that exceeds the sound barrier, creating the characteristic thunder they are known for. Overall, thunderstorms can contribute to flooding and heavy winds which pose a danger to people and infrastructure in the Philippines.
